The sun rises over the mountains, painting the sky in shades of pink and gold.
A gentle breeze rustles the leaves of the ancient oak trees in the forest.
Crystal-clear water flows down the rocky stream, creating a soothing melody.
Wildflowers bloom in vibrant colors, covering the meadow like a woven tapestry.
Birds sing their morning songs, filling the air with cheerful melodies.
